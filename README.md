## Humidity
**Volumetric humidity** can be obtained by ideal gas law:  
* _pV = nRT_ with _n = w/M_  
* i.e. _w/V = M/R * p/T_  

where p can be calculated by saturation vapor pressure _E(t)_ (Tetens, 1930) multiplied by **relative humidity**.  
* _E(t) = 6.1078x10^(7.5t/t+237.3)_
```
$ ./humidity.pl
Usage: humidity.pl -t TEMPERATURE -r REL_HUMID
```
```
$ ./humidity.pl -t 22.5 -r 30
VolHum : 5.992 g/m3 - Very dry (5g/m3 -> 50% flu survive, 7g/m3 -> 20% flu survive)
RelHum : 30% (consider 5% of error? 25-35%)
Temp   : 22.5 (consider 1 degree of error? 21.5-23.5)
ideally RH=55? +4.994 g/m3 -> 10.986 g/m3
VolHum range : 4.714 - 7.402 g/m3
```
Here RH=55% is considered as ideal humidity, and the program calculates how much water is necessary to realize it.

### Exprected errors
Following errors are taken into consideration.

RH
- 30 <= RH < 70: 5%
- RH >= 70, RH < 20: 10%

Temp
- 10 <= Temp < 40: 1
- Temp >= 40, Temp < 10 :2

Accordingly, the obtained VH may also have error to some extent.
